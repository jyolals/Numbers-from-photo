# Numbers-from-photo
The numbers in a LCD image is extracted using Image processing and Neural Network. 

The aim of the project is to extract the values from glucose measuring device using Image processing and Artificial Intelligence

## Libraries used
    1. Tensorflow
    2. Imutils
    3. OpenCv
    4. Matplotlib
    5. Sklearn
    

## Process Pipe Line
  1. Identify the LCD screen of the glucometer in a photo 
  
  2. Reduce the noise in the Region of Interest (ROI) and create a binary image of the ROI
  
  3. Identify the proper broder to extract the numbers individually
  
  4. Identify the number using Neural Network (used minist hand written database for training)
